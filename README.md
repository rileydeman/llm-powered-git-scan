## üß© Overview

`llm-powered-git-scan` is an **AI-assisted Git repository scanner** that analyzes commit diffs for potential **secrets**, **API keys**, or other **sensitive data** using the **OpenAI API**.

The tool clones or scans a given Git repository, iterates through recent commits, and sends code diffs to an LLM (like **GPT-4o-mini** or **GPT-5-mini**) for intelligent, context-aware security analysis.

It detects sensitive code patterns that traditional regex scanners often miss ‚Äî such as access tokens, credentials, or embedded API keys ‚Äî and generates a structured JSON report for auditing and review.

### **Core Features**
- ü§ñ AI-powered detection of sensitive data and secrets.
- üß† Uses **OpenAI GPT models** (no local inference required).
- üì¶ Automatically installs missing dependencies.
- üíæ Outputs detailed JSON reports to your Documents folder.
- ü™∂ Works on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**.
- üîç Scans both **local** and **remote (GitHub)** repositories.

### **Use case example**
> You provide a GitHub repo URL or local path.  
> The program clones or reads it, analyzes recent commits using an LLM, and saves a clean JSON report showing which code lines might expose secrets.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Follow these steps to install and run **gitscan**:

1. **Download the latest release**
   - Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/rileydeman/llm-powered-git-scan/releases) page.
   - Under **Assets**, download the file named **Source code (zip)**.
   - This will download a file such as `llm-powered-git-scan-1.0.0.zip`.

2. **Extract the files**
   - Right-click the ZIP file ‚Üí **Extract All...**
   - Choose a simple folder path, for example:  
     `C:\gitscan`

3. **Open Command Prompt in that folder**
   - Open the folder where you extracted the project.  
   - Click on the **address bar** in File Explorer (the path at the top).  
   - Type `cmd` and press **Enter** ‚Äî this will open Command Prompt directly in that folder.

4. **Add your OpenAI API key**
   - In the extracted folder, locate the file named `example.env`.  
   - Rename it to `.env`  
   - Open it with a text editor (like Notepad) and enter your API key:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-YOUR-API-KEY
     ```
   - Save and close the file.

5. **Run the program**
   Depending on your Python setup, one of the following commands will start the program:

   **Option 1 (most common):**
   ```bash
   python scan.py --repo "<repo_url_or_local_path>" --n <commit_count> --out "<output_name>.json"

   Option 2:
    ```bash
   py scan.py --repo "<repo_url_or_local_path>" --n <commit_count> --out "<output_name>.json"
    ```
   Example:
    ```bash
   python scan.py --repo "https://github.com/example/project.git" --n 10 --out "scan_results.json"
    ```
6. **First-time setup**
   - On your first run, the program will automatically:
     - Check for required Python packages (like `gitpython`, `tqdm`, `requests`, and `openai`).
     - Install any that are missing.
     - Restart itself automatically once installation is complete.

7. **Done!**
   - You‚Äôll see progress bars showing:
     - Git cloning progress (if a remote repository is being scanned)
     - Commit analysis progress
   - Once finished, your scan report will be automatically saved to:
     ```
     Documents/gitscan/<output_name>.json
     ```

   Example:
    ```
   C:\Users<yourname>\Documents\gitscan\scan_results.json
   ```
   You can open the JSON file in any text editor or JSON viewer to review detected sensitive data findings.


### üßπ Stopping the Scan
To stop the scan at any time, simply **close the Command Prompt window**.  
Temporary cloned repositories (for remote Git URLs) are automatically deleted after the scan completes.

## üíª Usage

Once installed and configured, you can start scanning repositories directly from the command line.


### üß© Basic Command

```bash
py scan.py --repo "<repo_url_or_local_path>" --n <commit_count> --out "<output_name>.json"
```

<tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>--repo</td>
        <td>The Git repository to scan. Accepts both local paths and remote URLs (e.g. https://github.com/user/repo.git).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>--n</td>
        <td>The number of recent commits to analyze.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>--out</td>
        <td>The name of the output JSON file that will be saved in your Documents/gitscan folder.</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### ‚öôÔ∏è What Happens During a Scan
1. **Repository detection**
   - If the path points to a **local repository**, it‚Äôs analyzed directly.
   - If it‚Äôs a **remote GitHub URL**, the repository is cloned into a temporary folder.
2. **Commit extraction**
   - The last *N* commits are retrieved.
3. **Diff analysis**
   - Each code change (`+` and `-` lines) is sent to the **OpenAI GPT model** for inspection.
4. **LLM evaluation**
   - The model identifies potential secrets, credentials, or sensitive information.
5. **Report generation**
   - All findings are saved into a structured JSON report inside your `Documents/gitscan` folder.


### üßæ Example Workflow

```bash
py scan.py --repo "https://github.com/org/app.git" --n 15 --out "report.json"
````

## üß© Troubleshooting

Having issues getting **gitscan** to run or generate reports correctly?  
Here are some common problems and their solutions:

### üîπ The program closes instantly
- This usually happens if **Python** isn‚Äôt installed or isn‚Äôt added to your system PATH.  
- Check by running:
  ```bash
  python --version
    ```
  or
  ```bash
  py --version
    ```
- If the command isn‚Äôt recognized, [download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and make sure to check **‚ÄúAdd Python to PATH‚Äù** during installation.
- You can also start the script manually to see error messages:
  ```bash
  py scan.py

### üîπ ‚ÄúMissing API key‚Äù or ‚ÄúInvalid API key‚Äù error
- Make sure you have a `.env` file in the same folder as `scan.py`.
- The file must contain your valid OpenAI API key:
    ```dotenv
  OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-YOUR-API-KEY
    ```
- Double-check that:
  - There are **no spaces or extra characters** in the key.
  - You did not include quotes (`"`) around it.
  - Your API key is **active** and associated with your OpenAI account.

### üîπ ‚ÄúRate limit‚Äù or ‚ÄúQuota exceeded‚Äù errors
- This means your OpenAI API plan has temporarily hit its usage limit.
- Solutions:
- Wait a few minutes and try again.
- If you use the **free trial**, you might need to upgrade to a paid account.
- Reduce your commit count (`--n`) to scan fewer diffs per run to save tokens.

### üîπ The scan is very slow
- Scanning time depends on:
  - The number of commits (`--n`).
  - The model used (e.g. `gpt-4o-mini` is faster than `gpt-5-mini`).
  - Your internet connection speed.
  - Tips to improve performance:
    - Reduce `--n` to scan fewer commits.
    - Use smaller repositories for testing.
    - Ensure no other heavy network tasks are running during the scan.

### üîπ The JSON report is empty
If your output JSON file is empty or incomplete:
1. Make sure the repository actually contains recent commits with code changes.  
2. Verify that your `--n` value is not larger than the number of available commits.  
3. Check the console output ‚Äî if you see parsing errors from the LLM, the model might have returned invalid JSON.  
4. Try running again with a lower number of commits or switching to a different model (`gpt-4o-mini` or `gpt-5-mini`).

### üîπ Permission denied or file write errors
- This can happen if the program doesn‚Äôt have permission to write to your Documents folder.  
- Try running Command Prompt **as Administrator**, or specify a different output name (without special characters).  
- Ensure your user account has write access to the Documents folder, example:
    ```
  C:\Users\<yourname>\Documents\gitscan\
  ```

### üîπ Temporary folder not deleted
- If the scan is interrupted before completion, the temporary cloned repository might not get removed automatically.
- You can safely delete it manually:
- On Windows:  
  ```
  %TEMP%\gitscan_tmp_*
  ```
- On macOS/Linux:  
  ```
  /tmp/gitscan_tmp_*
  ```

### üîπ Seeing CUDA or GPU-related errors
- These messages can be safely ignored.  
- OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models run **in the cloud**, not on your local GPU ‚Äî the program does not use CUDA or require a GPU.

### üîπ Still not working?
If you‚Äôve verified all the above steps and it‚Äôs still not working:
1. Close all terminal windows.
2. Reopen a new Command Prompt in your project folder.
3. Run:
    ```bash
    py scan.py --repo <repo_url_or_local_path> --n 5 --out "test.json"
    ```
4. Check the console output for detailed error information.

If issues persist, re-download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/rileydeman/llm-powered-git-scan/releases) page to ensure you‚Äôre using the newest build.
